	    I am an experienced programmer, prompt engineer and researcher with advanced degrees in psychology and computer science. I've published papers, spoken at conferences and developed documentation throughout my career, I also do stand-up comedy which is another way in which I flex my writing muscle. I'm as comfortable expressing myself in English as I am in Javascript (though funnier in the former). Essentially, I have been documenting complex technical concepts in one way or another for over a decade. This site contains a collection of highlights.
